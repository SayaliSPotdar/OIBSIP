Project 1 -   IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Description- The Iris flower classification project aims to develop a model that can accurately classify different species of Iris flowers based on their features. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret the dataset containing various measurements of Iris flowers, such as petal length, petal width, and sepal length. By training the model on the dataset, it learns the patterns and characteristics of each Iris species, allowing it to make predictions on new, unseen flower samples. The ultimate goal is to create a reliable and efficient classification system for Iris flowers, aiding in botanical research and flower identification.


Project 2 -   UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

Description- This project uses Python to analyze unemployment trends. collected and organized unemployment data. Then,used Python to explore and visualize the data, This helps us understand why unemployment happens and make predictions about the future.analyzed the unemployment rate. The project can help policymakers create better plans to address unemployment


Project 3 -   CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

Description-The aim of this project is to predict Car Price by analyzing various Car attributes,The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car,features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. A model is trained to understand their relationship with Price. The Dataset is preprocessed and suitable algorithm is chosen to train the model. It's performance is evaluated, This project will help buyers and sellers


Project 4 -   SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

Description- Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product. The aim of this project is sales prediction using python.
